In a 2 hours meeting from 18:30 to 20:30, i followed a step by step live tutorial about HTML, CSS (with focus on those two) and Javascript, made by two students, now tutors, of Edgemony.
This was a demo for a new bootcamp Edgemony is promoting about Front-end developement. Even thoug i am a DevOps and websites are not my forte, i am very curious about pretty
much anthing about programming. I thought about some silly WebApps like pointerpointer.com and wondered if i could make something even remotely similar. Turns out, like many other things,
i have a lot to learn. Nonetheless, it is still fascinating and i still want to make a silly WebApp.
